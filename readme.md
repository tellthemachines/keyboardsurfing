# Keyboard navigation problems and solutions

The starting point of this project was a demo for my Web Directions 2015 talk.

It is a work in progress and intends to keep track of current best practice regarding keyboard accessibility. 

It was also written from scratch in vanilla HTML, CSS (with Sass) and JS (with jQuery) which probably makes it a museum piece nowadays :-)
